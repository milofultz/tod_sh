# Tod

Simple pomodoro task manager

## What it does

* Manages tasks to do
* Tracks how many pomodoros you have done
* Enforces break time after a pomodoro is completed

## What it doesn't do

* Anything else

## Goals

Big goal here is to do stuff in C that isn't super trivial (at least for me). 

* file management
* curses
* command line options
